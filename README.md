CIS440 Personal Project

Throughout our capstone project, I had to do a lot of research on how to implement CRUD into the project. I could just went online and found a premade one but instead I learned PHP and decided to code each function into the capstone project from scatch. There were many difficult moment but ultimately it was a success so for my personal project I wanted to showcase a simple admin page that would allow you to create, read, update and delete contact information. The project was completely coded from scatch with html, css, php and mysql was used as the database platform. I tested everything on local and then preceded to move to servers-side testing through my cis425 class server. A live demo of my personal project can be found below.
